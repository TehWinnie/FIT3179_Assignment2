          <h1>Death</h1>
          <p>Death is an unalterable aspect of the human experience, a universal certainty that transcends national boundaries, cultural differences, and continental boundaries. It is a natural and unavoidable aspect of existence, but its impact on global societies has evolved over time, taking on new dimensions and posing new challenges. In recent years, death has become a significant issue in virtually every country, with a multitude of factors contributing to this worldwide dilemma.</p>

                        <h2>Deaths for Different Causes</h2>
                        <p>The amount of world deaths attributable to diseases is substantial. In innumerable countries, infectious and non-communicable diseases take a hefty toll on human life. Malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS continue to claim lives, particularly in regions with limited resources. 
                            
                            Simultaneously, non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes account for a significant proportion of global fatalities, which are frequently associated with lifestyle decisions and ageing populations. The burden of disease-related mortality is a stark reminder of the critical need for robust healthcare systems, preventive measures, and international cooperation to combat this pervasive problem.</p>

                <h2>Cancer</h2>
                <p>Cancer is a complex and devastating group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells within the body. 
                    
                    These cancerous cells disrupt the normal, highly regulated processes of cell division, causing them to multiply uncontrollably and potentially form malignant tumors. Cancer can affect virtually any tissue or organ, often leading to tissue damage and, in advanced stages, the potential for the cancer to spread to other parts of the body, a process known as metastasis. 
                    
                    It is caused by a combination of genetic factors, environmental exposures, and lifestyle choices, and it manifests in numerous different types, each with distinct characteristics, making it a significant global health challenge that necessitates comprehensive research, early detection, and a range of treatment approaches. </p>

        <h2>Total Average Cancer Deaths Rate (1990 ~ 2019) per 100,000 people</h2>
        <p>These are the maps that represent people according to their age range who have died because of cancer. We can observe that people above 70+ have the highest rate of death due to cancer, followed by the age group 50~69. By examining these maps, we can also observe the countries with the highest and lowest average Cancer Death Rates (1990 ~ 2019) per 100,000 people for each age range.</p>
